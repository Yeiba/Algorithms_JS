# Algorithms - Recursive Factorial

What is Recursion? :
Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem

Recursion is when a function calls itself
Why is Recursion? :
A Great technique to simplify your solution
 
If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem, recursion is very useful.
